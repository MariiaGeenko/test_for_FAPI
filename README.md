# test_for_FAPI
working with forms and third-party API

Created an HTML page with a simple submission form, where the buyer fills in basic personal 
information and can enter the product, including the price. When the number of items changes, 
the total price also changes. Created a validation for each element of the form. 
A recalculation including VAT will be displayed. Created a page with exchange rates.
